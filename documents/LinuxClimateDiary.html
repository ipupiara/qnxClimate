	<span style="font-size: 13pt">22. Sept 12: during the last two weeks, first 
	I installed Technical Solution's eclipse IDE running arm-linux-gnu gcc 
	crosstools under windows (not my idea, I would prefer using the IDE under 
	linux). One needs to get used to Technical Solution's eclipse IDE and it is 
	not satisfactory documented, but finally it worked. </span>
	<p><span style="font-size: 13pt">I took over the whole growbox application, 
	commented out all the interfaces to the OS and could easily compile and link 
	it. Also I could let it run on the Technical Solution's linux board under 
	debian linux. It was just printing out a &quot;Hello world&quot; message, but for a 
	first test I was rather satisfied. In the last few days I implemented the OS 
	threading-interface of the serial message receiver thread (not yet the com 
	interface), exchanging the windows-thread methods with posix threads, what 
	was rather straight-forward. By today, I could compile and link the posix 
	thread calls. Test will follow tomorrow or on monday.</span><p>
	<span style="font-size: 13pt">23. sept 12: threading tests ran&nbsp; ok and I 
	started work on the serial communication</span><p>
	<span style="font-size: 13pt">26. sept 12: picture of working place during 
	serial comms test</span><p>
	<img border="0" src="DSCF4615SelResized.jpg" width="638" height="480"><p>on 
	the very right, the white stick on the black box is the upper part of the hygrosense 
	temperature/humidity sensor, that sends its values via serial communication 
	to the embedded linux board (at the left side of the notebook). The serial 
	sgnal can also be seen on the oscilloscope who's probes are connected on the 
	serial tester (between the linux board and the hygrosense sensor). On the 
	notebook screen one can see an ssh terminal (connected via ip) showing the 
	sensor values arriving on the linux board. On the right side of the hotebook 
	lies the not yet connected relais board which later will control the 
	humidity/drying and heating/cooling equipments.<p>27. sept 12: today the 
	serial communication was tested ok. So as next I will work on the ini-file 
	integration, using a simple library for embedded systems I found today on 
	the internet (<a href="http://www.compuphase.com/minini.htm" target =_blank> 
	http://www.compuphase.com/minini.htm</a> ).<p>28. sept 12: ini file methods 
	tested ok, and meanwhile also NonPosixTimers are ready for testing. I could 
	not use the posix timers, because I could not find anywhere on the delivered 
	IDE-CD a lib file that supported the posix timer methods. There is a chaotic 
	amount of lib files, and versions of them.... It is hard to work with this 
	IDE and one can see, that it was not used so often by developers. But 
	anyhow, I will try to continue with the delivered development toolchains and 
	IDE with the goal to come to a working application as soon as possible. When 
	once the application runs, I then will try to compile a library on my own 
	and to integrate all the needed methods, but for now this would consume too 
	much time and delay the solution for too long (&quot;time to market&nbsp; :-) . <p>
	30. Sept 12: over the weekend I worked on the soap integration (
	<a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soap.html" target = _blank>
	http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soap.html </a>) using gsoap with wich I made 
	best experiences in the past (Siemens TTS). A first soap implementation is 
	compilable and ready to test. Also GPIO (general purpose input/output 
	{programming the signals of single pins on the chip}) controlling the relais-board is 
	ready for testing. So now, to a big part, the implementation of the whole 
	application is&nbsp; done, and mainly testing will follow, as well as web-UI 
	integration.<p>

	did some works on the embedded linux software and also created a gsoap 
	client application, now testing continues: Today I tested NonPosixTimers 
	with success.</span><p>

	will be added while further developing all the rest.<br />

    23. Oct 23: After I tested all the different parts, today I &quot;plugged&quot; together 
    the whole application and it run perfectly well. Now it can be used to control the 
    climate within a grow room or grow box. </span>

	output, the order of startup and eventual failures or resource conflicts.</span><p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 13pt">10. Jan 2013: during December, I did 
	extensive tests with the application. It worked rather well except that the 
	board itself does not work on a stable level. It is simply low quality, that 
	crashed during tests with any configuration of loaded program components 
	(eg. fsm-implementation, Soapserver, hygrosense interface, console 
	logger....). When it crashed, most often the os just was blocked completely, 
	what makes debugging difficult. Sometimes also it reset itself.&nbsp; 
	Sometimes it worked 4 hours before crashing, next time it stopped working already after 5 
	minutes ....just randomly. It was an awful testing.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 13pt">As consequence I ordered today a very much 
	proven </span><font style="font-size: 13pt"><span itemprop="description">
	AT91SAM9M10-EKES from one of my favorite mcu manufacturer ATMEL. I plan to 
	use qnx to compile my application and test it on this board.</span></font><p>
	<span style="font-size: 13pt">25. Feb 2013: five days ago I started working 
	with qnx on a AT91SAM9M10-ek board. QNX is simply great, so far works 
	without problems and everything one need to know is well documented. Now I 
	will start transferring my LinuxClimate application to qnx.</span><p>3. Mar 
	2013: <span style="font-size: 13pt">after a few hours of reading qnx docus, 
	and after successful fights against the qnx compiler and linker, who 
	sometimes loose references to methods&nbsp; (google confirmed me that I was 
	not the first with this problem) - finally - at the end, I was surprisingly 
	astonished how good remote debugging and running the code on the 
	AT91SAM9M10-EK worked -- just state of the art ! By now, I already tested 
	the main-thread and all the gsoap remote UI-code, and all this worked 
	perfectly well. </span>
